matlab lift group project

Hello this is the github for the matlab lift group project

Parts:
- Simulink model
- Stateflow state model
- App ui interface
- 3d model?

Inports/Outports Structure:

How do the models interact with oneanother???

Outside display of the lift must have the up/down arrows to let the user know the status of the lift.
