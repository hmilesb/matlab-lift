# matlab-lift
This is the GitHub Repository for Group Y4, ES2D7 - Systems and Software Principles - Lift Project. 

To run the final model with app interface go to "/Final_Project_Files/Simulink_Model.slx". Run the Simulink_Model.slx and the App Interface will open automatically.

It is important that the entire Folder "Final_Project_Files" is downloaded with Simulink_Model.slx, as it refers to other files within that directory. 

MATLAB 2021a is required to run the functioning model.
